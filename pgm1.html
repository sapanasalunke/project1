  <h2>The article</h2><ul>
  <li>Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child 
  and has said he later ran his own stall.</li>
  <li> He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long
   association with the organisation. Modi left home after finishing high-school in part due to child marriage 
   to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, which he abandoned and publicly acknowledged only many decades later.</li> 
   <li> In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country 
     in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding</li>
  <li>The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he
   held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.</li>
<li>Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public 
  image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after.
   His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, or otherwise criticised
    for its handling of it.</li>
    <li> His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth,
      have received praise. His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, 
      poverty and education indices in the state</li>
